How to Install Panther Data in InterProScan 5
=============================================

InterProScan 5 includes the Panther member database
(http://www.pantherdb.org/)

The Panther model files are very large and do not change
with every InterProScan 5 release, therefore they are provided
in a separate distribution.

1. Before Installing Panther Data:
----------------------------------

First ensure you have:

- Extracted the appropriate 32-bit or 64-bit distribution of InterProScan 5;

The path where this is extracted will be referred to below as [InterProScan5 home].


2. Download the Panther model data
----------------------------------

- Downloaded the latest Panther data files from the FTP site into the
[InterProScan5 home]/data/ directory:

cd [InterProScan5 home]/data/

wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/iprscan/5/data/panther-data-7.2.tar.gz;
wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/iprscan/5/data/panther-data-7.2.tar.gz.md5

The panther distribution is a very large file, (approximately 4.6 GB) so you should check the MD5
checksum on the file after you have downloaded it:

md5sum -c panther-data-7.2.tar.gz.md5

This must return *panther-data-7.2.tar.gz: OK*
If not - try downloading the file again as it may be a corrupted copy.

2. Install Panther Data:
------------------------

Extract the Panther data files to the required location, e.g.

cd [InterProScan5 home]/data

tar -pxvzf panther-data-7.2.tar.gz


3. OPTIONAL: Installing Panther in a different location
-------------------------------------------------------

You may wish to install the Panther model files in a different location on the
file system.  If you do this, you will need to edit the
[InterProScan5 home]/interproscan.properties file and set the following
two properties to point to the correct location:

panther.models.dir.7.2=PATH_TO/panther/7.2/model
