#  Version 3.3 - 10/13/95
#     Added alternate intiation codon ATC to code 5
#        based on complete mitochondrial genome of honeybee
#        Crozier and Crozier (1993)
#
#  Version 3.2 - 6/24/95
#     GTG allowed as alternate initiator
#
# Comment: 
# 
# The codon AGG is absent in Drosophila. 
# 
# Differences from the Standard Code: 
# 
# 
#         Code 5          Standard
# 
#  AGA    Ser  S          Arg  R
#  AGG    Ser  S          Arg  R
#  AUA    Met  M          Ile  I
#  UGA    Trp  W          Ter  *

# 
# Alternative Initiation Codons: 
# 
# AUA, AUU
# AUC: Apis (Crozier and Crozier, 1993)
# GUG: Polyplacophora (Boore and Brown, 1994 GenBank Accession Number: U09810)
# UUG: Ascaris, Caenorhabditis
# 
# Systematic Range:
# 
# Nematoda: Ascaris, Caenorhabditis;
# Mollusca: Bivalvia (Hoffmann et al., 1992); Polyplacophora (Boore and
# Brown, 1994)
# Arthropoda/Crustacea: Artemia (Batuecas et al., 1988);
# Arthropoda/Insecta: Drosophila [Locusta migratoria (migratory locust),
# Apis mellifera (honeybee)]
# 
# Comments: 
# 
# GUG may possibly function as an initiator in Drosophila (Clary and
# Wolstenholme, 1985; Gadaleta et al., 1988).  AUU is not used as an
# initiator in Mytilus (Hoffmann et al., 1992). 
# 
# "An exceptional mechanism must operate for initiation of translation of
# the cytochrome oxidase subunit I mRNA in both D.  melanogaster (de
# Bruijn, 1983) and D.  yakuba (Clary and Wolstenholme 1983), since its
# only plausible initiation codon, AUA, is out of frame with the rest of
# the gene.  Initiation appears to require the "reading" of of an AUAA
# quadruplet, which would be equivalent to initiation at AUA followed
# immediately by a specific ribosomal frameshift.  Another possible
# mechanism ...  is that the mRNA is "edited" to bring the AUA initiation
# into frame." (Fox, 1987)
