#
# Differences from the Standard Code: 
# 
#           Code 14      Standard
# 
#  AAA      Asn  N       Lys  K
#  AGA      Ser  S       Arg  R
#  AGG      Ser  S       Arg  R
#  UAA      Tyr  Y       Ter  *
#  UGA      Trp  W       Ter  *
# 
# 
# Systematic Range: 
# 
# Platyhelminthes (flatworms) 
# 
# Comments:
#
# Code 14 differs from code 9 only by translating UAA to Tyr rather than
# STOP.  A recent study [PMID:11027335] has found no evidence that the
# codon UAA codes for Tyr in the flatworms but other opinions exist. 
# There are very few GenBank records that are translated with code 14 but
# a test translation shows that retranslating these records with code 9
# can cause premature terminations.  Therefore, GenBank will maintain code
# 14 until further information become available.
