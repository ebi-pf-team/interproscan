#  Version 3.2 - 6/24/95
#     Eubacterial renamed to Bacterial as most alternate starts
#                 have been found in Archaea
#
# Differences from the Standard Code: 
# 
# None 
# 
# Alternative Initiation Codons: 
# 
# GUG, UUG, AUU, CUG 
# 
# Systematic Range and Comments: 
# 
# Table 11 is used for Bacteria, Archaea, prokaryotic viruses and
# chloroplast proteins.  As in the standard code, initiation is most
# efficient at AUG.  In addition, GUG and UUG starts are documented in
# Archaea and Bacteria (Kozak 1983, Fotheringham et al.  1986, Golderer et
# al.  1995, Nolling et al.  1995, Sazuka & Ohara 1996, Genser et al. 
# 1998, Wang et al.  2003).  In E.  coli, UUG is estimated to serve as
# initiator for about 3% of the bacterium's proteins (Blattner et al. 
# 1997).  CUG is known to function as an initiator for one plasmid-encoded
# protein (RepA) in Escherichia coli (Spiers and Bergquist, 1992).  In
# addition to the NUG initiations, in rare cases Bacteria can initiate
# translation from an AUU codon as e.g.  in the case of poly(A) polymerase
# PcnB and the InfC gene that codes for translation initiation factor IF3
# (Polard et al.  1991, Liveris et al.  1993, Sazuka & Ohara 1996, Binns &
# Masters 2002).  The internal assignments are the same as in the standard
# code though UGA codes at low efficiency for Trp in Bacillus subtilis
# and, presumably, in Escherichia coli (Hatfiled and Diamond, 1993).
