#     Added code 23 Thraustochytrium mitochondrial code
#        formerly OGMP code 93
#        submitted by Gertraude Berger, Ph.D.
#
# This code has been created for the mitochondrial genome of the labyrinthulid
# Thraustochytrium aureum sequenced by the The Organelle Genome Megasequencing
# Program (OGMP).
#
# It is the similar to the bacterial code (trans_table 11) but it contains an
# additional stop codon (TTA) and also has a different set of start codons.
