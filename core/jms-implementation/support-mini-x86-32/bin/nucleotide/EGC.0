#   Version 3.1 - 1995
#      Initial base data set from Andrzej Elzanowski (PIR/NCBI)
#
# Differs from Genetic Code [1] only in that the initiation sites have been
# changed to only 'AUG'.
#
# This is intended to be the default genetic code where the use of
# the rare initiation sites (CUG, UUG) is not intended.
