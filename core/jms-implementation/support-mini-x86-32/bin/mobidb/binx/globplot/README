Quick install:

-install python2.2+
-install Biopython from www.biopython.org

-download TISEAN source: http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/archive.html#source
-compile the TISEAN package and get the sav_gol binary from the TISEAN_2.1/source_c directory,
move it to the same directory as this archive was extracted to or change the path in
the SavitzkyGolay routine.

run globplot: ./GlobPlot.py


note: only Russell/Linding propensities are currently in the script,
you can replace them manually or mail and ask me to do it...but these
parameters are the ones we had best results with!


input: sequence_file is a fasta or file with multiple fasta sequences in!
output: note that the masking is OPPOSITE the one the www servers is giving,
CAPITAL letters means GlobDom or disorder!




cheers
