Q: Why is there no SignalP binary in this directory?

A: SignalP is licensed software, therefore the SignalP files have not been included with InterProScan 5.

The "signalp" perl script and it's associated files can be downloaded from the Internet (SignalP website) and
extracted into this directory if required (or another directory on the file system).

Once you have the required files in place on your system then the interproscan.properties file can be updated
accordingly.
