ps_scan is a perl program used to scan one or several patterns, rules and/or
profiles from PROSITE against one or several protein sequnces in Swiss-Prot or
FASTA format. It requires two compiled external programs from the PFTOOLS
package : "pfscan" used to scan a sequence against a profile library and
"psa2msa" which is necessary for the "-o msa" output format only.

Installation
------------

Download a binary package for your platform from 

ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/prosite/tools/ps_scan/ps_scan_<platform>.tar.gz

or the source packages from

ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/prosite/tools/ps_scan/sources/

in which case you will need gcc or a compatible fortran compiler to compile the
pftools sources.

You may need to edit the ps_scan.pl to provide absolute paths to the directory
where you have installed the pfscan and psa2msa executables, unless you have
stored them in a directory in your PATH.

A local copy of the PROSITE database is also needed. You may download it
in a single file from

ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/prosite/release_with_updates/prosite.dat

Usage
-----

perl ps_scan.pl [options] sequence-file(s)
ps_scan version $VERSION options:
-h : this help screen
Input/Output:
  -e : specify the ID or AC of an entry in sequence-file
  -o : specify an output format : $formats_string
  -d : specify a prosite.dat file
  -p : specify a pattern or the AC of a prosite motif
  -f : specify a motif AC to scan against together with all its 
       releated post-processing motifs (but show only specified 
       motif hits)
Selection:
  -r : do not scan profiles
  -m : only scan profiles
  -s : skip frequently matching (unspecific) patterns and profiles
  -l : cut-off level for profiles (default : 0)
Pattern match mode:
  -x : specify maximum number of accepted matches of X's in sequence
       (default=1)
  -g : Turn greediness off
  -v : Turn overlaps off
  -i : Allow included matches

The sequence-file may be in Swiss-Prot or FASTA format.
If no PROSITE file is submitted, it will be searched in the paths
$PROSITE/prosite.dat and $SPROT/prosite/prosite.dat.
There may be several -d, -p and -q arguments.

Pfsearch options:
  -w pfsearch : Compares a query profile against a protein sequence library.
  A profile file must be specified with option -d.

   $progname -w pfsearch [-C cutoff] [-R] -d profile-file seq-library-file(s)

 -R: use raw scores rather than normalized scores for match selection
 -C=# : Cut-off value. Reports only match score higher than the specified 
        parameter.
An integer argument is interpreted as a raw score value,
a decimal argument as a normalized score value. An integer value forces 
option -R.


Output formats
--------------

An output format may be specified with the -o option. Here are the available
formats, with an example output with a profile :

-o scan : default ps_scan output format.

-o pff : tabular format listing bounding positions on the sequence and the
         profile, the raw and normalized profile score, and the cut-off level.

YAHD_ECOLI	12	37	ANK_REPEAT	8	-1	196	6.653	-1

YAHD_ECOLI	176	201	ANK_REPEAT	1	-8	343	10.579	0

Pattern and rule matches are reported in the same formats, but cut-off levels
are not available. In scan, psa and msa output formats, amino acids matching an
"x" in the pattern are reported in lowercase. In pff format only the first
three columns are available. The "-o matchlist" output format is specific to
patterns and not meant for public use.


Profile and pattern matching parameters
---------------------------------------

Several parameters can be fine-tuned. 

- profile cut-off levels (-l option)

  Most profiles contain several cut-off levels. The level 0 cut-off is the
  trusted cut-off for positive matches, but a level -1 is usually defined above
  which a match is potential, especially if there are other matches in the
  sequence with the profile. By default, pfscan is run with the cut-off
  level 0, so that only trusted matches are reported. To retrieve potential
  (weak) matches as well, run ps_scan with the option "-l -1". Weak matches
  are then reported with the indication "L=-1".

- skip frequently matching patterns (-s option)

  Some PROSITE entries such as those describing commonly found post-
  translational modifications (a typical example is N-glycosylation) are found
  in the majority of known protein sequences. While it is generally useful to
  note their presence, some programs may want, in some cases, to ignore those
  entries, which contain the line "CC   /SKIP-FLAG=TRUE;".

Pattern match mode:

- pattern greediness off (-g option)

  A pattern-matching engine is said to be "greedy" if it tries to extend at
  most variable-length pattern elements. The sequence "ABCDC" and the pattern
  "A-x(1,3)-C" will produce the match "ABCDC" with a greedy engine, and the
  match "ABC" with a non-greedy one. By default, PROSITE is scanned in greedy
  mode, unless the -g option is set.

- overlaps (-v option) and included matches (-i option)

  Some patterns may produce distinct but overlapping matches on a given
  sequence.  Additionally, if the pattern contains variable-length elements,
  some of these matches may be completely included in another one. Different
  combinations of -g, -v and -i options may produce differences in match count
  and match positions with patterns that contain variable-length elements. An
  engine which allows overlaps should be greedy in order to reduce the number
  of multiple hits which are almost entirely overlapping except at the
  extremities.

- treatment of X characters in sequences (-x option)

  The PROSITE syntax describes how to treat ambiguities in the pattern, but not
  how to handle ambiguities in the sequence. In rare sequences in Swiss-Prot
  and other databases, the characters B and Z are used according to IUBMB
  nomenclature when a residue may be either Asp or Asn, or Glu or Gln,
  respectively. The ps_scan program will produce a match if the sequence has a
  "B" and the pattern allows either a "D" or a "N", or both (and similarly for
  Z).

  Whether the character X should be allowed to match any position of a pattern
  is more controversial. It is generally useful to accept a single pattern
  position to match X (unless that pattern position is an X itself, in which
  case we can accept more). The maximum number of X characters which are
  allowed to match a non-X position in a pattern can be specified with the -x
  option. The default value is 1.
