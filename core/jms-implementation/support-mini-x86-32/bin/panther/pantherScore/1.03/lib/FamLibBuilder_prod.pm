=head1 NAME

FamLibBuilder_prod - manages access & creation of "prod" (published) version
of the Panther Family Libraries

=head1 DESCRIPTION

FamLibBuilder manages the access to Panther libraries so that the internal 
directory structure is hidden from the user.  A FamLibBuilder object 
represents one library.  The books and entries within a library are
represented by FamLibEntry objects.  The primary use of a FamLibBuilder object
is to access the FamLibEntries inside it. 

FamLibBuilder_build is a subclass of FamLibBuilder, and allows access to the
build version of the library.

Do not access FamLibBuilder_prod directly - use FamLibBuilder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use FamLibBuilder;

    my $flb = new FamLibBuilder($library,"prod");
    &usage("Cannot find library $library.\n") unless ($flb->exists());

    # loop over all books in the library
    @books = $flb->bookNames(); 
    foreach my $book (@books) {

        # get book entry
        my $fle = $flb->getLibEntry($book, $type);

	# use FamLibEntry as desired here
	...
    }

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 new

Creates and returns a FamLibBuilder object referencing the directory
pointed to by $library.  

=item Usage:

    my $flb = new FamLibBuilder($library);

=item Parameters:

$library: the filepath to the library directory

=item Returns:

B<a valid FamLibBuilder object> on success

No failure mode defined

=item Notes:

The directory pointed to by $library need not exist at time of instanciation.
Use create() or assureExists() to create the library directory structure.

Do not access directly - access through the corresponding method in
FamLibBuilder.

### sub new()
###
sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $libName = shift;
    my $self = {};
    $self->{libName} = $libName;
    $self->{FamLibVersion} = $FamLibVersion;

    bless $self, $class;
    return $self;
}


=head2 exists

Checks to see if Family Library has a directory structure 
on the filesystem.

=item Usage:

    my $bool = $flb->exists()

=item Parameters: 

None.

=item Returns:

B<undef> if directory does not exist or is not a FamLib

B<1> if directory exists and is a valid FamLib

=item Notes:

Does not check for existence of the failed and old directories.  
These directories are created (if they do not already exist) by the 
oldDir method and the failedDir method.

Do not access directly - access through the corresponding method in
FamLibBuilder.

		 -d $self->globalsDir());
    return undef;
}


=head2 assureExists

create a Family Library directory structure on the filesystem
if and only if it does not exist.

=item Usage:

    $errcode = $flb->assureExists();

=item Parameters: 

None.

=item Returns:

B<-1> if library already exists

B<undef> on failure

B<1> on success

=item Notes:

B<Either this method or exists() should always be called before
using the FamLibBuilder instance>

Use this method if you are creating a new library entry or are overwriting
an old one.

Use exists() if your code must work from existing library contents.

B<This method supercedes create().>

Do not access directly - access through the corresponding method in
FamLibBuilder.
