Developer notes:

Q: Why are there no Phobius binaries in this directory?

A: Phobius is licensed software, therefore the Phobius files have not been included with InterProScan 5.

The "decodeanhmm" binary, the "phobius.pl" perl scirpt and other associated files can be downloaded from the Internet
(Phobius website) and extracted into this directory if required (or another directory on the file system).

Once you have the required files in place on your system then the interproscan.properties file can be updated
accordingly.
