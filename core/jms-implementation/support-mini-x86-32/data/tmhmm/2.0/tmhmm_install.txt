Q: Why are there no TMHMM models in this directory?

A: TMHMM is licensed software, therefore the model files have not been included with InterProScan 5.

The "TMHMM2.0.model" file and other associated files can be downloaded from the Internet (TMHMM website) and extracted
into this directory if required (or another directory on the file system).

Once you have the required files in place on your system then the interproscan.properties file can be updated
accordingly.
