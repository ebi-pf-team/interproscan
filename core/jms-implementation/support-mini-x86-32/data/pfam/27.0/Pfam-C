#=GF CC   For motile cells such as Amoeba to move, there must be the rapid
#=GF CC   recycling of their actin cytoskeleton to enable a dynamic change in
#=GF CC   their shape. Gelsolin (PFAM:PF00626) and Cofilin (PFAM:PF00241) are 
#=GF CC   two key domain families in this process.  Both of these domain are 
#=GF CC   structural and functional similar [1,2].  In particular, the beta
#=GF CC   sheet found at the core of the domain is structurally well conserved,
#=GF CC   with the helices that surround this sheet less conserved[2].
