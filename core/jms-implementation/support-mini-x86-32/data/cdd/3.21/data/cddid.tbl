238120	cd00199	WAP	whey acidic protein-type four-disulfide core domains. Members of the family include whey acidic protein, elafin (elastase-specific inhibitor), caltrin-like protein (a calcium transport inhibitor) and other extracellular proteinase inhibitors. A group of proteins containing 8 characteristically-spaced cysteine residuesforming disulphide bonds, have been termed '4-disulphide core' proteins. Protease inhibition occurs by insertion of the inhibitory loop into the active site pocket and interference with the catalytic residues of the protease.	60
188645	cd00958	DhnA	Class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolases of the archaeal type (DhnA homologs). Class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolases of the archaeal type (DhnA homologs) found in bacteria and archaea. Catalysis of the enzymes proceeds via a Schiff-base mechanism like other class I aldolases, although this subfamily is clearly divergent based on sequence similarity to other class I and class II  (metal dependent) aldolase subfamilies.	235
239245	cd02947	TRX_family	TRX family; composed of two groups: Group I, which includes proteins that exclusively encode a TRX domain; and Group II, which are composed of fusion proteins of TRX and additional domains. Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif. Group II proteins, in addition to either a redox active TRX or a TRX-like domain, also contain additional domains, which may or may not possess homology to known proteins.	93
239775	cd04242	AAK_G5K_ProB	AAK_G5K_ProB: Glutamate-5-kinase (G5K) catalyzes glutamate-dependent ATP cleavage; G5K transfers the terminal phosphoryl group of ATP to the gamma-carboxyl group of glutamate, in the first and controlling step of proline (and, in mammals, ornithine) biosynthesis. G5K is subject to feedback allosteric inhibition by proline or ornithine. In microorganisms and plants, proline plays an important role as an osmoprotectant and, in mammals, ornithine biosynthesis is crucial for proper ammonia detoxification, since a G5K mutation has been shown to cause human hyperammonaemia. Microbial G5K generally consists of two domains: a catalytic G5K domain and one PUA (pseudo uridine synthases and archaeosine-specific transglycosylases) domain, and some lack the PUA domain. G5K requires free Mg for activity, it is tetrameric, and it aggregates to higher forms in a proline-dependent way. G5K lacking the PUA domain remains tetrameric, active, and proline-inhibitable, but the Mg requirement and the proline-triggered aggregation are greatly diminished and abolished, respectively, and more proline is needed for inhibition. Although plant and animal G5Ks are part of a bifunctional polypeptide, delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), composed of an N-terminal G5K (ProB) and a C-terminal glutamyl 5- phosphate reductase (G5PR; ProA); bacterial and yeast G5Ks are monofunctional single-polypeptide enzymes. In this CD, all three domain architectures are present: G5K, G5K+PUA, and G5K+G5PR.	251
199208	cd08964	L-asparaginase_II	Type II (periplasmic) bacterial L-asparaginase. Asparaginases (amidohydrolases, E.C. 3.5.1.1) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. In bacteria, there are two classes of amidohydrolases. This model represents type II L-asparaginases, which tend to be highly specific for asparagine and localized to the periplasm. They are potent antileukemic agents and have been used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but not without severe side effects. Tumor cells appear to have a heightened dependence on exogenous L-aspartate, and depleting their surroundings of L-aspartate may starve cancerous ALL cells. Type II L-asparaginase acts as a tetramer, which is actually a dimer of two tightly bound dimers. A conserved threonine residue is thought to supply the nucleophile hydroxy-group that attacks the amide bond. Many bacterial L-asparaginases have both L-asparagine and L-glutamine hydrolysis activities, to a different degree, and some of them are annotated as asparaginase/glutaminase.	319
206756	cd10019	14-3-3_sigma	14-3-3 sigma, an isoform of 14-3-3 protein. 14-3-3 protein sigma isoform, also known as stratifin or human mammary epithelial marker (HME) 1, has been most directly linked to tumor development. In humans, it is expressed by the SFN gene, strictly in stratified squamous epithelial cells in response to DNA damage where it is transcriptionally induced in a p53-dependent manner, subsequently causing cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint. Up-regulation and down-regulation of 14-3-3 sigma expression have both been described in tumors. For example, in human breast cancer, 14-3-3 sigma is predominantly down-regulated by CpG methylation, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a prognostic indicator, while in human scirrhous-type gastric carcinoma (SGC), it is up-regulated and may play an important role in SGC carcinogenesis and progression. Loss of 14-3-3 sigma expression sensitizes tumor cells to treatment with conventional cytostatic drugs, making this protein an attractive therapeutic target. 14-3-3 domains are an essential part of 14-3-3 proteins, a ubiquitous class of regulatory, phosphoserine/threonine-binding proteins found in all eukaryotic cells, including yeast, protozoa and mammalian cells.	242
410909	cd19501	RecA-like_FtsH	ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH. FtsH ATPase is a processive, ATP-dependent zinc metallopeptidase for both cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. It is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane such that the amino- and carboxy-termini are exposed to the cytoplasm. It presents a membrane-bound hexameric structure that is able to unfold and degrade protein substrates. It is comprised of an N-terminal transmembrane region and the larger C-terminal cytoplasmic region, which consists of an ATPase domain and a protease domain. This RecA-Like FTsH subfamily represents the ATPase domain, and belongs to the RecA-like NTPase family which includes the NTP binding domain of F1 and V1 H(+)ATPases, DnaB and related helicases as well as bacterial RecA and related eukaryotic and archaeal recombinases. The RecA-like NTPase family also includes bacterial conjugation proteins and related DNA transfer proteins involved in type II and type IV secretion.	171
409299	cd21157	PUA_G5K	PUA domain of gamma-glutamyl kinase, found in archaea, bacteria, and eukarya. Gamma glutamyl kinase (G5K) is an enzyme essential for the biosynthesis of L-proline; it catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group to glutamate. The resulting glutamate 5-phosphate cyclizes spontaneously to form 5-oxoproline. The PUA (PseudoUridine synthase and Archaeosine transglycosylase) domain functions as an RNA binding domain in many other proteins; however, its role in G5K is not understood. It might play a role in modulating the enzymatic properties of bacterial G5Ks.	104
