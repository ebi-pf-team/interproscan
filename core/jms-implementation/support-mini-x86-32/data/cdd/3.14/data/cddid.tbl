99707	cd00009	AAA	The AAA+ (ATPases Associated with a wide variety of cellular Activities) superfamily represents an ancient group of ATPases belonging to the ASCE (for additional strand, catalytic E) division of the P-loop NTPase fold. The ASCE division also includes ABC, RecA-like, VirD4-like, PilT-like, and SF1/2 helicases. Members of the AAA+ ATPases function as molecular chaperons, ATPase subunits of proteases, helicases, or nucleic-acid stimulated ATPases. The AAA+ proteins contain several distinct features in addition to the conserved alpha-beta-alpha core domain structure and the Walker A and B motifs of the P-loop NTPases.	151
238120	cd00199	WAP	whey acidic protein-type four-disulfide core domains. Members of the family include whey acidic protein, elafin (elastase-specific inhibitor), caltrin-like protein (a calcium transport inhibitor) and other extracellular proteinase inhibitors. A group of proteins containing 8 characteristically-spaced cysteine residuesforming disulphide bonds, have been termed '4-disulphide core' proteins. Protease inhibition occurs by insertion of the inhibitory loop into the active site pocket and interference with the catalytic residues of the protease.	60
239775	cd04242	AAK_G5K_ProB	AAK_G5K_ProB: Glutamate-5-kinase (G5K) catalyzes glutamate-dependent ATP cleavage; G5K transfers the terminal phosphoryl group of ATP to the gamma-carboxyl group of glutamate, in the first and controlling step of proline (and, in mammals, ornithine) biosynthesis. G5K is subject to feedback allosteric inhibition by proline or ornithine. In microorganisms and plants, proline plays an important role as an osmoprotectant and, in mammals, ornithine biosynthesis is crucial for proper ammonia detoxification, since a G5K mutation has been shown to cause human hyperammonaemia. Microbial G5K generally consists of two domains: a catalytic G5K domain and one PUA (pseudo uridine synthases and archaeosine-specific transglycosylases) domain, and some lack the PUA domain. G5K requires free Mg for activity, it is tetrameric, and it aggregates to higher forms in a proline-dependent way. G5K lacking the PUA domain remains tetrameric, active, and proline-inhibitable, but the Mg requirement and the proline-triggered aggregation are greatly diminished and abolished, respectively, and more proline is needed for inhibition. Although plant and animal G5Ks are part of a bifunctional polypeptide, delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), composed of an N-terminal G5K (ProB) and a C-terminal glutamyl 5- phosphate reductase (G5PR; ProA); bacterial and yeast G5Ks are monofunctional single-polypeptide enzymes. In this CD, all three domain architectures are present: G5K, G5K+PUA, and G5K+G5PR.	251
