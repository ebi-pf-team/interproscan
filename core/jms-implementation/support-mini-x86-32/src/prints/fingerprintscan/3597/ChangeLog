	* replaced cout with printf for some output in PathFinder.cc as one some user systems this was printing hex numbers?
        e.g. cout << setw(12) << eval; replaced with  printf("%-12.2g",eval);

	* Calculation method: now E=p.(N/n) by default and -M causes E = p.D to be
	calculated

2007-07-24	Stephen Hall <sphall@manchester.ac.uk>
	
	* Mystring.cc: We now dynamically assign buffers to prevent overruns

2007-02-13	Stephen Hall <sphall@manchester.ac.uk>

	* PathFinder.cc: Set output field pos to be six chars wide to cope
	with sequences >9,999 amino acids long at lines 1013,1055

2006-06-06	Nick Gresham <n.gresham@manchester.ac.uk>

	* renamed: *.hpp, *.cpp to *.h and *.cc respectively

	* removed ANSI C++ deprecated headers throughout:
	#include <iostream> instead of #include <iostream.h> 
	#include <cmath> instead of #include <math.h> 
	etc.

	* import standard namespace throughout:
	using namespace std;

	* redundant qualification of methods in class scope removed to allow
	compilation under gcc 4.1: 
	e.g. mystring.h line 84
	int mystring::length() const; replaced by 
	int length() const;

	* PathFinder.cpp: char literals adjusted at lines 1097,1098,1099,1100
	setfill(32) replaced with setfill('\x20')
	setfill(4)  replaced with setfill('\x4')

	* FrequencyTable.cc: API change to count() at line 381
	count(prof.begin(),prof.end(),*x,counter); replaced with
	counter = count(prof.begin(),prof.end(),*x)
	
	* FrequencyTable.cc: correct types to supplied to pow() at lines 592,670,757
	if (!pval) { pval = 1.0 / (1.0 * pow(10,16)); } replaced with
	if (!pval) { pval = 1.0 / (1.0 * pow(10.0, 16)); }
	
	* FingerPrint.cc: correct types to supplied to pow() at line 1940 
	PvalueThreshold = 1.0 / double(pow(10, p)); replaced with
	PvalueThreshold = 1.0 / double(pow(10.0, p));

	* FingerPrint.cc: multiline string lines 15-41 \ added at end of each
	line

	* preliminary attempt to bring code under GNU autotools:
	supplied acinclude.m4, configure.in and Makefile.am

	* minor directory adjustments: moved history to NEWS, license to AUTHORS, 
	started ChangeLog, deleted GNU_GENERAL_PUBLIC_LICENCE, added COPYING (GPL 2.1)
