SFLD search/post-processing
===========================

Building
--------

Example makefile - note that you will have to install the easel library to compile this

$> wget http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer3/3.1b2/hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz
$> tar xf hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz
$> cd hmmer-3.1b2
$> ./configure
$> make
$> make check
$> cd ..
$> make sfld_preprocess
In the Makefile replace the path in EASEL_DIR with the 'easel' subdir of the hmmer
distribution (e.g. /path/to/hmmer-3.1b2/easel). Then run
$> make sfld_postprocess

Running
-------

1) Pre-process alignments to build HMM and extract site-level annotation

$> sfld_preprocess -a SFLD.sto -m SFLD.hmm -s SFLD.annot

2) Run the search

$> hmmsearch --cut_ga -o all.out --domtblout all.dom -A all.aln DIR/FAMILY.hmm DB/TARGETDB

3) Post process

$> sfld_postprocess -d all.dom -s SFLD.annot -a all.aln -O all.out

Notes/Issues
------------

- the options to hmmbuild/hmmsearch are hardcoded
- optional env variables: HMMER_PATH (dir of hmmer binaries), SFLD_LIB_DIR (SFLD HMM dir), SFLD_OUTPUT (dir with output files)
