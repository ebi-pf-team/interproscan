    /**
     * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning
     * of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
     * intent is that, for any object <tt>x</tt>, the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
     * will be true, and that the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
     * will be <tt>true</tt>, but these are not absolute requirements.
     * While it is typically the case that:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
     * will be <tt>true</tt>, this is not an absolute requirement.
     *
     * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
     * <tt>super.clone</tt>.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
     * <tt>Object</tt>) obey this convention, it will be the case that
     * <tt>x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</tt>.
     *
     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
     * by <tt>super.clone</tt> before returning it.  Typically, this means
     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by <tt>super.clone</tt>
     * need to be modified.
     *
     * The method <tt>clone</tt> for class <tt>Object</tt> performs a
     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>, then a
     * <tt>CloneNotSupportedException</tt> is thrown. Note that all arrays
     * are considered to implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     *
     * The class <tt>Object</tt> does not itself implement the interface
     * <tt>Cloneable</tt>, so calling the <tt>clone</tt> method on an object
     * whose class is <tt>Object</tt> will result in throwing an
     * exception at run time.
     *
     * @return a clone of this instance.
     * @throws CloneNotSupportedException if the object's class does not
     *                                    support the <code>Cloneable</code> interface. Subclasses
     *                                    that override the <code>clone</code> method can also
     *                                    throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
     *                                    be cloned.
