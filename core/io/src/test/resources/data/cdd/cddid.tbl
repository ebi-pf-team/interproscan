153270	cd00011	BAR_Arfaptin_like	The Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain of Arfaptin-like proteins, a dimerization module that binds and bends membranes. The BAR domain of Arfaptin-like proteins, also called the Arfaptin domain, is a dimerization, lipid binding and curvature sensing module present in Arfaptins, PICK1, ICA69, and similar proteins. Arfaptins are ubiquitously expressed proteins implicated in mediating cross-talk between Rac, a member of the Rho family GTPases, and Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) small GTPases. Arfaptins bind to GTP-bound Arf1, Arf5, and Arf6, with strongest binding to GTP-Arf1. Arfaptins also binds to Rac-GTP and Rac-GDP with similar affinities. The Arfs are thought to bind to the same surface as Rac, and their binding is mutually exclusive. Protein Interacting with C Kinase 1 (PICK1) plays a key role in the trafficking of AMPA receptors, which are critical for regulating synaptic strength and may be important in cellular processes involved in learning and memory. Islet cell autoantigen 69-kDa (ICA69) is a diabetes-associated autoantigen that is involved in membrane trafficking at the Golgi complex in neurosecretory cells. ICA69 associates with PICK1 through their BAR domains to form a heterodimer which is involved in regulating the synaptic targeting and surface expression of AMPA receptors. BAR domains form dimers that bind to membranes, induce membrane bending and curvature, and may also be involved in protein-protein interactions.	203
276965	sd00038	Kelch	Kelch repeat. Kelch repeats are 44 to 56 amino acids in length and form a four-stranded beta-sheet corresponding to a single blade of five to seven bladed beta propellers. The Kelch superfamily is a large evolutionary conserved protein family whose members are present throughout the cell and extracellularly, and have diverse activities. Kelch repeats are often in combination with other domains, like BTB and BACK or F-box domains.	140
