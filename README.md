## What is InterProScan?
[InterPro](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) is a database which integrates together predictive information about proteins' function from a number of partner resources, giving an overview of the families that a protein belongs to and the domains and sites it contains.

Users who have novel nucleotide or protein sequences that they wish to functionally characterise can use the software package InterProScan to run the scanning algorithms from the InterPro database in an integrated way.  Sequences are submitted in FASTA format. Matches are then calculated against all of the required member database's signatures and the results are then output in a variety of formats.
